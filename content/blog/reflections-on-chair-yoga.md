My chair yoga is for those
who can no longer touch their toes.
<!--more-->
We hobble in on cane and brace
And sit in our allotted place.

We bend and stretch with all our might
Its truly not a pretty sight.


I watch these bodies loose and slack,
Yet know that just a while back
These same forms were tight and smooth
And they could with the slightest move
Really set a man on fire
Eager, and full of desire.


Those days are gone, alas alack
And sadly they're not coming back.


So to all the young I say
We had our turn, back in the day
And now its yours, go have some fun
For its your short time in the sun.
