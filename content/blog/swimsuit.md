My daughter has a new house,
She says it is the rule
That anyone who stays there
Has to use the pool.
<!--more-->

I say sorry, but my swimsuit
Doesnt fit me any more
She says , well get another one
It's not as though you're poor.

Shopping for a swimsuit
Is not a happy time
But trust me, it gets much much worse
When one is past one's prime

Finally I find one
It's black and quite discreet
But I'd prefer a burkha
Which would only show my feet

One day she says"I'm off now
Dont forget to use the pool
But first check that there are no snakes
That is another rule

What do you mean? I say with fear
You mean there's snakes that swim?
Of course, she says, you haven't heard
Of water moccasins?

And so my suit stays clean and dry
Still wearing its sales tag
And there it will remain I think
Within its Macy's bag.
