My husband's dead
He hasn't "passed"
Or gone to a better place
He's dead.
<!--more-->

Words matter.
"passed" gives hope that in a while
Once again you'll see him smile
But he's dead.

There are no signs
Sent from above
As proof that I'm the one he loved
He's dead.

No matter what you say to me
That things are as they have to be
The world is now a harsh cruel place
Because he's dead.
