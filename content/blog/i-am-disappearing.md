Once upon a time, 
I was a whole person.
Married, had a family
And all was right with the world.

My husband longed to emigrate.
I loved him, so I went along
Leaving a country dear to me
And a huge extended family.
And there was less of me.
<!--more-->

I sucked it up,as after all
Others have it worse.
We prospered,grew
As did the hole
And there was less of me.

A young son died at 27
Cancer was the cause.
And after we had said goodbye
Not a lot was left of me.

But what was left, grew old.
My husband died.
And just a wisp is left of me.
