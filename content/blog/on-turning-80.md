When one gets to 80
The problems are weighty.

Not only ones health
And protecting the wealth
<!--more-->

But the small inner voice
Says at every life choice

One took the wrong way
And now every day there is constant replay

And the worst thing of all
Is when you recall

The scenes in ones head
Are of people long dead.
