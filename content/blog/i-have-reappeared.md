Is it really just 6 months ago
My life was full of gloom
When all that I could see ahead
Was the descent to the tomb.

And now each day is full of hope
The world's a glorious place,
What happened to this sad old soul
To make this change take place.

A dear sweet man is in my life
A miracle for sure.
I still cant quite believe it
When he comes in through my door,

Now in this mature body
Is a girl of 17
Who checks her smart phone hourly
To see if he is on the screen.

I look at him across the table
He's aged and suffered just like me
But when he smiles right at me
I feel weak about the knees.

And while we were out driving
On a sunny summer day
I realized I was happy
Buried feelings now at play.

This interlude could well be short
He could ail or die or leave
But I'll always be so grateful
For this wonderful reprieve.
