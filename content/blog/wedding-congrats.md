When Matthew finally got married (we had given up hope!) I wrote this for his wedding

<!--more-->
This lovely day, 14th of June
Could not come a day too soon
For we are growing old and weary
Tired of feeling sad and teary

For why cannot our lovely boy
Find a girl to bring him joy?
He seemed to me like any other
But then of course,I am his mother

We agonized and gnashed our teeth
How could he give us so much grief
Where is the family and wife?
But no, he seems to want a life

Of travelling from shore to shore
Because he says ,
There's always more
I need to see, and then explore

But gradually the urge to roam
Died down a bit,and he came home
Then before much time had passed
He called to say-At last, at last

I'm overjoyed, I'm in a whirl
I've met the most amazing girl
I know i've left it very late
But she is truly my soul mate

We could hardly wait to see
And yes, we heartily agree
Toni makes the wait worthwhile
Just to watch them makes us smile

And so on this lovely day
Let us altogether say
CONGRATULATIONS MATT AND TONI
