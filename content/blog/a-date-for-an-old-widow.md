title = "A Date For An Old Widow"
+++

It's not a husband that I seek
For once I had the best
But someone who is also lost
And wants to use the time that's left.
<!--more-->

It would be nice to have a man
For whom I'd cook a dinner
And who'd bring me cups of tea
If I was neath the weather

Widowers are oft besieged
By casseroles galore
But no one calls upon the phone,
Or knocks on old widows doors

So when I found a message
Left by my husband's friend
Saying "someone wants to meet you
Can I your number send?"

I really was excited
Whatever shall I wear?
Something that makes me thinner
And I'll have to fix my hair

I call him for the details
And he says happily
"I know you 2 will get on
Cos you're from the same country

It is an older lady
Who runs a chicken farm"
You mean  the "he's" a "she"
I say with something of alarm

So that's my dating up to date
My last was back in' 58
Maybe I should have followed through
A chicken farmer would be new

(and I could have used the eggs)
