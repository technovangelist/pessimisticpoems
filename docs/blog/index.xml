      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time,&lt;br /&gt;
I was a whole person.&lt;br /&gt;
Married, had a family&lt;br /&gt;
And all was right with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband longed to emigrate.&lt;br /&gt;
I loved him, so I went along&lt;br /&gt;
Leaving a country dear to me&lt;br /&gt;
And a huge extended family.&lt;br /&gt;
And there was less of me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Those who read my poems know&lt;br /&gt;
The place where I was forced to grow&lt;br /&gt;
Was by the docks, all grey and gritty&lt;br /&gt;
But what I longed for was the city,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter has a new house,&lt;br /&gt;
She says it is the rule&lt;br /&gt;
That anyone who stays there&lt;br /&gt;
Has to use the pool.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was working as a nurse, the hospital held a limerick competition for St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s day. I won a potted shamrock for my efforts!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Memories Stirred By The Nightly News</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know you think it is a bore&lt;br /&gt;
When I go on about the war&lt;br /&gt;
But every day the nightly news&lt;br /&gt;
Treats us all to awful views&lt;br /&gt;
Of homes turned into rubble&lt;br /&gt;
And then it turns to trouble&lt;br /&gt;
As the memories flood in&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mum reached the age of 86&lt;br /&gt;
And found herself in quite a fix&lt;br /&gt;
Of stomach pains she had a bout&lt;br /&gt;
She had to have some stuff cut out&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a husband that I seek&lt;br /&gt;
For once I had the best&lt;br /&gt;
But someone who is also lost&lt;br /&gt;
And wants to use the time that&amp;rsquo;s left.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My husband&amp;rsquo;s dead&lt;br /&gt;
He hasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;passed&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Or gone to a better place&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s dead.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When one gets to 80&lt;br /&gt;
The problems are weighty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only ones health&lt;br /&gt;
And protecting the wealth&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was a shelter in the yard&lt;br /&gt;
Of corrugated iron&lt;br /&gt;
The government provided it&lt;br /&gt;
To give us safe environs.&lt;br /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on the table&lt;br /&gt;
And the doctor looks at me&lt;br /&gt;
The biopsies are back,&lt;br /&gt;
And you do have the big C.&lt;br /&gt;

      <guid>http://pessimisticpoems.com/blog/reflections-on-chair-yoga/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My chair yoga is for those&lt;br /&gt;
who can no longer touch their toes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We hobble in on cane and brace&lt;br /&gt;
And sit in our allotted place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
